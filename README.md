# 📘 Machine Learning Classification Tasks

This repository contains my implementation of **three important machine learning classification algorithms**:

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

All tasks were implemented using **Python** and **scikit-learn**, with proper data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## 📌 **Tasks Overview**

### ✅ **Task 1: Logistic Regression**

In this task, Logistic Regression was implemented on multiple datasets to perform **binary and multiclass classification**.

Key concepts covered:

* Handling missing values
* Converting categorical data to numerical form
* Train-test split
* Model evaluation using accuracy score

Datasets used include Titanic, Iris, Breast Cancer, Social Network Ads, and Credit Card Fraud.

### ✅ **Task 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

In this task, KNN models were implemented to understand **distance-based classification**.

Key concepts covered:

* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Choosing the value of k
* Binary and multiclass classification
* Model evaluation using accuracy score

Datasets used include Pima Indians Diabetes, Social Network Ads, Iris, Wine Recognition, and Handwritten Digits.

### ✅ **Task 3: Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

In this task, Support Vector Machine models were implemented to understand **margin-based classification**.

Key concepts covered:

* Feature scaling
* Kernel functions (Linear and RBF)
* Binary and multiclass classification
* Model evaluation using accuracy score

Datasets used include Forest CoverType, Iris, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Wine Recognition, and Banknote Authentication.
